# Project 1: Pandemic Pantry

Group Five:  
Jeffery Adamo, Alyssa Hellrung, Bipin Maharjan

## Description

A web app that allows users to search for recipes based on an ingredient they have at home. Results can be tailored to fit dietary preferences and intolerances. 

## User Story

AS A person who wants to cook a meal with the limited ingredients I have at home,  
I WANT to search for recipes using various criteria  
SO THAT I can easily find something to make for dinner.
 
## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a recipe dashboard with form inputs  
WHEN I enter an ingredient  
THEN I am presented with a short description of the ingredient I entered as well as four recipe cards. Each recipe card contains the name of a recipe, a photo of the finished recipe, the remaining ingredients required, instructions, and a link to the recipe source.  
WHEN I select from the set of DIETARY CHOICES presented in my search  
THEN the resulting recipes are constrained to either vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, or no constraints.  
WHEN I select from a set of INTOLERANCES listed as checkboxes  
THEN the resulting recipes will not contain any of the ingredients of the checkboxes selected.
